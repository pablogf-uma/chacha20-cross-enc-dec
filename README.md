<h1 align="center">ChaCha20 Crossed-End Encryption</h1>


This program utilizes the implementation of the regular chacha20 algorithm and its vectorized versions (128 and 256-bit respectively) to encrypt and decrypt a plaintext.

For a given plaintext, each chacha20 implementation encrypts, and the other two decrypt, showing the correct functioning of the cryptosystem across its different vectorized and non-vectorized versions.
